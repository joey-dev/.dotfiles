- fix json files
- add emmet_ls to nvim
- add todo finder in current branch/open files
- find better snippets tool
- add to pipeline, check if all roles are there, and no `#`
- find tests for file: https://kushellig.de/vim-switch-tests-files/
- open php manual with keybind: alvan/vim-php-manual
- create todo script (for when installing a new system, or maybe update like DBeaver settings), should be called after make provision, and saved in a local .env file:
	- asks to generate ssh key
		- says to link it to: github, homeserver
	- ask to set-up syncthing key
	- ask to setup protonpass
	- ask to import DBeaver settings
- add new distro (with less bloat, maybe arch)
- add ai code assistent
- find alt for project plugin (amiorin/vim-project + startify)
- add syncthing (for task)
- remove lsp-zero, and change it to ale if possible
- see if sqlfluff works with sql written in php (https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff)
- look into the following for nvim integrations with ale and ?php:
	- cspell
	- intelephense
	- langserver
	- phan
	- psalm
	- tlint
	- php
- add phpcs
