- create todo script (for when installing a new system, or maybe update like DBeaver settings), should be called after make provision, and saved in a local .env file:
	- asks to generate ssh key
		- says to link it to: github, homeserver
	- ask to set-up syncthing key
	- ask to setup protonpass
	- ask to import DBeaver settings
